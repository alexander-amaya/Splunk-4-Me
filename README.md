# Splunk-4-Me
### Utilizing Splunk's SPL to generate a report for a fictional company <br></br>

## Scenario
The company "Buttercup Enterprises" is a large national online retailer operating in the US, which sells a variety of books, clothing, and other gifts through its online website. Buttercup Enterprises have recently invested in Splunk and now they want to start making use of it across the business.

My responsibility is to provide insights to users throughout the company. The teams I will support include: IT Operations, DevOps, Business Analytics, and Security and Fraud

The business wants me to create a dashboard with four views:
 • IT Operations team: Investigate successful versus unsuccessful web server requests over time
  
 • DevOps team: Show the most common customer operating systems and which web browsers are experiencing the most failures
  
 • Business Analytics team: Show lost revenue from the Buttercup Enterprises website
  
 • Security and Fraud team: Show website activity by geographic location
  
 • Buttercup Enterprises: Add all of this to a single dashboard with a custom background image
